    Big o notation 


    - it shows us the performace of agorithms 
    

    Big O rules

    - O(1) - constant time
    - O(log n) - logarithmic time
    - O(n) - linear time
    - O(n^2) - quadratic time
    - O(2^n) - exponential time


    Let say we have (4n) it would be O(n)

    we can drop any constant factors like numbers
